# COMP3101 - Final Project (OS Subsystem Animation)
The final project for COMP3101, Operating System, UWI Mona

# I/O System
How Interrupts, DMA, and device controllers/drivers work and interact with the OS and process blocking. For example, when a logical I/O call is made by a process, show how a call goes through the O/S, the device driver, the controller, and work DMA.
